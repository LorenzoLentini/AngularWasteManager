# WasteManagerProject

This project aims to serve as an exercize about understanding main concepts of OOD (Object Oriented Developpement)

The final goal of this project is to get datas form given sources (in this case so city database presented as json files used as mockups) and treat/allocate trashes from a city
 to all the recycling/coposting/incinerating services available near it.

 The project must contains most (if not all) of the main concepts of OOD while integrating some SOLID method principles.
